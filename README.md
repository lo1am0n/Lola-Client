# Lola Client - 1.8.9 PVP Client
## What is this?
Lola Client is a Minecraft client designed specifically for 1.8.9. It was made to provide features that improve the overall experience (without giving an unfair advantage).

## Features
### 1.7 Hit Reg
Lola Client has 1.7 hit reg built-in for most Minecraft servers. It basically removes the 1.8 hit delay (when you miss an attack, your hits are delayed). 

If you would like to have this feature disabled for your server, contact Te1a on the Discord.

### Auto Sprint and other QoL features
Vanilla clients don't have certain features, so we added some, including Auto Sprint and Free Look.

### Open Source
Since a lot of PVP clients are closed source, we decided it would be nice to make ours open-source. Feel free to open pull requests and/or build it yourself!

## Notices
This project is WIP, so expect to see bugs upon release. If you find a bug, please report it!
